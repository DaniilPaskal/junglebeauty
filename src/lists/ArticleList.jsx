                    We often see requests to get a kitten at the age of 8-10 weeks, with some
                    websites recommending this age for adoption.

                    Beware it is very risky to adopt a Bengal kitten at that age, as they can
                    easily get infected. Some breeders may find it easy to release a Bengal
                    kitten at this age, but no responsible and reputable breeder should act this
                    way. If you see that a breeder agrees or wants to release a kitten at this
                    age, it is a big warning sign. Usually, it is a way to reduce the price, but
                    an ethical breeder should never sacrifice the wellbeing of their animals for
                    the sake of a lower price for the buyer (<a href='https://thebengalconnection.com/articles/bengal-cat-price/'>https://thebengalconnection.com/articles/bengal-cat-price/</a>).

                    Weaning usually only starts at the age of 4-6 weeks in Bengal kittens and may
                    last until 10-12 weeks or even later. Kittens consume less and less mother's
                    milk but it is crucially important for them to receive some antibodies from
                    the mother and build the immune response to viruses and bacteria with some
                    support. The actual building of the kitten's immune system and immune response
                    start during and continue after weaning, though some kittens may not be ready
                    even after the second vaccination and need to be with their mom until 14 weeks
                    of age or even later.

                    From our experience, we see that adoption at the age of 8-10 weeks is very risky
                    for Bengal kittens and may result in the kittens not surviving their immunity gap
                    period. In the period of weaning and right after, Bengal kittens have an immunity
                    gap period, which means they stop having a sufficient amount of mother's
                    antibodies to protect them but have not yet developed the immune response to
                    produce their own antibodies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If they face deadly viruses during this period, the illness may progress so quickly
                    (1-2 days) that even veterinarians do not have enough time to help, and their little
                    bodies may be so harmed that nothing can be done. Bengal kittens need very intensive
                    attention and care during the immunity gap period which the average kitten owner may
                    not be able to provide. The weakness should be identified right away as sometimes
                    hours count, especially in the case of panleukopenia. Also, kittens have small bodies
                    and can easily lose too much fluid in diarrhea and vomiting, and fade away from
                    dehydration and lethargy.

                    To summarize, Bengal kittens are very vulnerable and defenceless at the age of 8-12
                    weeks, which is why most cat organizations have ethical rules for breeders to release
                    kittens after 12 weeks of age and at least two FVRCP vaccinations. However, it is common
                    in Bengals for the immunity gap period to last up to 16-17 weeks of age. Thus, it is
                    pretty safe to adopt a Bengal kitten at the age of 3.5 or 4 months. Responsible breeders
                    will do it on request or at least provide 3-7 days of general health warranty, which gives
                    you the option to return the kitten at the first sign of weakness during the first days or
                    week and get help from the breeder with no additional vet expenses.

                    It is important to keep in mind that vaccination does not give 100% protection and works
                    best if 3 sets of the FVRCP vaccine are given. Only 3 sets are considered full vaccination,
                    and there is a reason for that. When the mother's milk is consumed, kittens cannot develop
                    the full immune response as the mother's antibodies are prevalent. The first 1-2 FVRCP vaccines
                    are usually given when Bengal kittens still consume mother's milk so the 3rd vaccine is needed
                    to verify that the immune response is adequate and ensure the kitten is not getting sick after that.
                    Adopting a Bengal kitten older than 4 months of age gives your kitten more protection and you
                    can be more confident that the kitten has a strong immune system.

                    You can asses the kitten by appearance and behaviour. A health kitten is active, willingly interacts 
                    with people, has fast reactions, a clean thick coat, and clean eyes, nose, and ears. Bengal kittens 
                    are usually very muscular, and can easily run and jump up and down, gracefully landing on their paws.
                    Healthy Bengals use the litter box with no problem, are alert enough to hunt, and play with almost
                    everything they can find.

                    Kittens from a good breeder are usually well-socialized and do not have problems adjusting to their 
                    new home and new owners if they are more mature. It is a big myth that only young kittens can accept
                    people as their parents, but it is not true. Cat and kittens of any age can love and trust new owners
                    if they do not feel threatened by humans at an early age. The problem occurs when they have a bad
                    experience with people, which is why it is important to research breeders before adopting a Bengal
                    kitten, as even nice-looking kittens may have behavioural problems.
