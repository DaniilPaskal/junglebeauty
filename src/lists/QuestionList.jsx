                Bengals like any other cats (if they are healthy) attack people for one reason: they feel unsafe, and want to defend themselves. For that reason they may attack dogs 
                and try to scratch their eyes. You will need to understand what happened and find the reason if your cat starts attacking someone at your house. Most probably that 
                person(s), often kids, was forceful with your cat and the cat started thinking that it is better to attack first and avoid the same danger that they experienced before. 
                It will take time for the cat to believe in that person again, and of course it will require some work.

                <p>
                Punishment can destroy the relationship between you and your cat. What is punishment? -
                </p><p>
                If people do something unpleasant or painful for the cat, in such situation every cat can start thinking that that human is attacking them. They may not connect punishment 
                to something they have done. Cats always think they have done everything correctly.
                </p><p>
                The best time to show to cat that something is wrong is to demonstrate the proper behaviour right away after or during the wrong actions of the cat. Stop the 
                wrong action, offer an alternative, prevent the wrong action from happening/demotivate your cat to do so, and give a treat/please your cat for the correct actions. Training 
                is always better than punishment. That is why if you want to stop some unwanted action it is better to do it in such a manner that the cat does not see the owner is stopping 
                them. For example, if you use a water gun to stop the cat, do it when your cat does not see the water gun in your hands.
                </p><p>
                Bengal cats are highly trainable, they love learning! Always show the correct way by offering an alternative to unwanted behaviour.
                </p><p>
                Remember that a lot of actions an intact cat does are caused by hormones and it is hardly possible to stop them without desexing. Spay/neuter your cat to avoid health and 
                behavioural problems: allow them to be a healthy and happy pet!

                <p>
                In Bengal kitten boys tend to be more curious and vocal, and also more rambunctious and more interested in interacting with people. They usually follow owners in everything they do. 
                Bengal girls tend to be more careful and considerate, and also usually more bossy. They can do some crazy things but it is not very common. You see that Bengals are very active cats 
                if compare with other breeds. Of course there are exceptions as always, and some girls can be like boys or some boys can be like girls. You can find some information online, we 
                just share our cattery experience.

                <p>
                Yes, like every cat they can do some damage, mostly scratching. Every cat has a natural right to be a cat. As Bengals are highly active and curious they can damage some items as well. 
                Basically you have to choose to have a cat or to have perfect and completely ordered house. Bengals are not an exception. If you are not ready for that please reconsider having a cat.

                Yes, they can. However, they are reported as <a href='https://www.petmd.com/cat/slideshows/care/10-hypoallergenic-cats'>hypoallergenic</a> as they rarely cause allergies.

                <p>
                We release kittens when we see that they are ready to go; usually it occurs at the age of 12-16 weeks. However if the kitten has some temporary disorder or is too attached to the mom 
                we may keep them longer. We never put our kittens at risk or release them sick.

            <p>
            Bengal cats are a good source of therapy from an early age. However, it is very important to chose a people oriented and friendly kitten. Bengals can be the source of a lot of positive emotions 
            as you can simply enjoy their appearance, their silky coat, golden or silver glitter, gorgeous movement and of course their intelligence and jumps.

            <p>
            The deposit has two purposes - to reserve the kitten and to be used for neutering. Our Junglebeauty Bengals Cattery takes a deposit of CAD 400. We do not support backdoor breeding and try to 
            eliminate it the best way we can. If we are unable to do neutering with our clinic then you have to do it with your vet and the deposit will be returned to you in full upon the proof of neutering/spaying.

                Please tell us about yourself, as without this information we can not see you as a serious buyer. Tell us if you are interested in male or female kittens specifically. You are welcome to ask questions, 
                but we expect you to do some research about Bengals first. We are happy to share our experiences of having Bengals as not all information on the internet is correct.

                <p>
                We may ask you for CAD 100 to put you in the waiting list which will be counted towards the reservation fee in the future.
                </p><p>
                You can ask us to put you in the waiting list if no kittens are available or you are waiting for a kitten from a specific queen/king.
                </p><p>
                We will notify people from the waiting list before advertising, so you will have priority to choose if you are interested at that time. If you did not pay to be in the waiting list, we will wait 
                24 hours for your reply after notification, then discard your name from the list if we do not get any reply from you. Please tell us how would you like to be notified - email or text message over 
                the phone. If your name is discarded from the waiting list you will not have priority to choose a kitten, however you are welcome to contact us for the available kittens.
                </p><p>
                In case you are registered for the waiting list with CAD 100, it will be subtracted from the reservation fee which is normally CAD 300 for the pet. We will wait for your reply within 3 days and you will 
                always have priority to choose from available kittens. However if you do not reply within 3 days the first priority to pick the kitten may be given to the next interested person.

                We have a <Link className='text-link' to='buy-sell-agreement'>Buy/Sell Agreement</Link> form for that.
                </p><p>
                You will need to sign it before transferring the deposit so please get familiar with it first.
                </p><p>
                We will sign the agreement when we get the deposit and will send the full signed copy to you. It is a proof that the kitten is reserved for you which means they will not be offered to 
                someone else.
