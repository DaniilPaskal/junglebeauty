        <h1>How to visit JungleBeauty Bengal Cattery</h1>
        <h3>We are always happy to meet our customers in our home.</h3>
        <h3>To visit our cattery in person and see the kittens, we ask you to do the following:</h3>
        <br/>
        <ol className='list-container'>
          <li>
            Please write a letter telling us a little about yourself and your experience with cats, especially Bengals. Also, please describe what kind of kitten you are looking for by colour, character and temperament.
          </li><li>
            Please arrange an online meeting where you can see those kittens you are interested in for 15-20 minutes and discuss possible questions.
          </li><li>
            After the online meeting, we will send you a deposit agreement if you are interested in the special kitten. Please sign the deposit agreement to reserve a specific kitten and pay the deposit of 400 CAD.
          </li><li>
            Next, agree on a meeting time within the next three days.
          </li><li>
            During the personal meeting, you can see the kitten and play with them if they have received two standard sets of vaccinations. This session lasts 30-40 minutes.
          </li><li>
            If you are not satisfied with the selected kitten, you can replace them with another one or refuse to purchase them and get back the entire deposit amount.
          </li><li>
            After three days from the moment of booking a kitten, the deposit amount is not refundable.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <br/>
        <p>
          Thus, visiting our cattery is impossible without a preliminary online meeting and making a deposit.
        </p><p>
          Understanding is very much appreciated as many people want to come and see the kittens without any intention of buying one or presenting any ID.
        </p><p>
          For us, each visit means preparation and then sanitization of the rooms. There are a lot of viruses and bacteria, many of which are carried on people's shoes and clothes.
        </p><p>
          Exceptions can be discussed in unique cases.
        </p>
