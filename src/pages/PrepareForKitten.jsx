                You need a carrier for the kitten to bring them home safely and take them to the vet clinic later on.
                We recommend having a carrier big enough for a full grown cat. It can be a soft carrier or a plastic carrier. We suggest having a double door carrier; here is an example:

                You need a litter box for the kitten. For example:
                <p/>
                Note: our kittens are trained to use different litter boxes - from simple tray to open top to enclosed.

              Kittens like the Cat Drinking Fountain. Many cats and especially Bengals love running water. That is why they prefer to drink from the tap or fountains. It also encourages them to drink more which is very important for cat health. Just do not forget to refresh the water every 1-2 days. For example:
                <p/>

                Heating pad for the kitten. Just recommended. We would recommend buying such a pad with settings for 80-130℉. For example:

                Nail care: trim front paw nails every 2-3 weeks. We found toenail clippers for people work best for this purpose. Please buy a high quality item to avoid discomfort and injury. For example:

                The exercise wheel is one of the most popular items for Bengals. They absolutely love it. However, you can buy it later on when the kitten is over one year old. For example:

              Our kittens have tried the raw diet which is recommended for Bengal Cats. We will share more details on pick up time. Food samples will be provided. We recommend Big Country Raw with Pure Chicken and IronWillRaw with Basic Chicken.

        <h2>How our kittens are fed</h2>
        <ol className='list-container'>
          <li>
            Water is available at all times.
          </li><li>
            Dry food is available at all times.
          </li><li>
            Canned food is given as is and given 3 times per day (3-4 soup spoons per portion).
          </li><li>
            Raw food is given 3 times per day. Total amount is approximately 10% of kitten's weight per day. For example, if the kitten weighs 2kg, you can give them 200 grams per day divided into 3 portions for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
          </li><li>
            We would recommend not feeding the kitten with canned and raw food at the same time. Please choose which diet you want to proceed with.

        <h2>Best supplements for the kitten</h2>

        <h2>Environment</h2>
        <p>Bengals are very energetic cats. They love to jump everywhere and use everything to play; it is their nature. Thus it is good to have surfaces (tables, countertops, shelves) clear of any items with which they are not allowed to play :-)</p>
