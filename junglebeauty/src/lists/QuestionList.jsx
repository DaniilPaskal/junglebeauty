        body: `Bengals as any other cats (if they are healthy) attack people for one reason: they feel danger, they want to rescue themselves. The same way they attack dogs trying to scratch dogs eyes. You will need to understand what happened before and find the reason if your cat started attacking someone at your house. Most probably that person(s), often kids, forced or punished your cat before and the cat started thinking that it is better to attack first and avoid the same danger as he/she experienced before. It will take time for the cat to believe in that person again, and of course it will require some work.`

        title: `Bengal Cats: punishment or training?`,
        body: `Punishment can destroy the relationship between you and your cat. What is punishment? -

        If people do something not pleasant or causes pain for cat. In such situation every cat can start thinking that human is attacking him/her. She/he may not connect panishment to something she/he has done. Cats always think they have done everything correctly.
        
        The best time to show to cat that something is done not the right way is to explain the proper behaviour right away after or during the wrong actions of the cat. Stop the wrong action, offer an alternative, prevent the wrong action from happening/demotivate your cat to do so, and give a treat/ please your cat for the correct actions. Training is always better than punishment. That is why if you want to stop some unwanted actions it is better to do it in such a manner that the cat does not see the owner is stopping him. For example, if you use a water gun to stop the cat, do it when your cat does not see the water gun in your hands.
        
        Bengal cats are highly trainable, they love learning! Always show the correct way by offering an alternative to unwanted behaviour.
        
        Remember that a lot of actions the intact cat does are caused by hormones and it is hardly possible to stop them without desexing. Spay/neuter your cat to avoid health and behavioural problems: allow him/he to be a perfect and happy pet!
